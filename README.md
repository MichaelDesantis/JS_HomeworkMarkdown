## Homework Details

This homework is designed to prepare you for questions you may face during an interview. It should take you no more than 3 hours. It's akin to an open book quiz since you can use the internet to look things up. But first, try going through and seeing how many questions you can answer without using google/stackoverflow/anyOtherInternetSource! And then go back and look up the answers to the ones that stumped you.
